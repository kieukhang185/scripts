Here’s a quick breakdown of what gives that video its instantly recognisable “lo-fi hip-hop radio” feel:

Audio style – mellow, “lo-fi” hip-hop

24 / 7 stream of down-tempo hip-hop instrumentals (roughly 70–90 BPM) built from jazzy chords, soft drums, muted bass lines and vinyl crackle.

Tracks are deliberately mixed with a slight analogue “warmth” and imperfections (tape hiss, clipped transients) that evoke 1990s-era home-recording gear – the hallmark of lo-fi/chillhop.

No rapping and almost no vocals; it’s meant to sit in the background while you study, code or relax.

Visual style – cosy, Ghibli-inspired study loop

The looping animation shows the “Lofi Girl” (officially named Jade) writing in a notebook at her desk with a cat dozing nearby and a cityscape outside the window.

Artist Juan Pablo Machado was asked to create a “Miyazaki-esque” scene after the channel’s original loop (a direct frame from Whisper of the Heart, 1995) triggered a copyright strike. That Ghibli influence explains the warm lighting, soft outlines, muted earth-tones and gentle background motion (subtle rain, passing clouds, day/night cycle).

Overall aesthetic

Combines the audio’s relaxed hip-hop beat with an endlessly repeating, hand-drawn slice-of-life anime vignette – a “digital fireplace” for focus and calm.

The stream’s steady popularity has made this combination the template for thousands of similar lo-fi channels; when people say “lo-fi study beats,” they usually mean exactly this style.

Here’s a ready-to-copy prompt you can paste into most text-to-music generators (e.g., Suno, Stable Audio, MusicGen) to get a track in that classic “Lofi Girl / 24-7 study beats” vibe. Feel free to tweak any bracketed values (like BPM) or add/remove descriptors to taste:

Prompt

Genre: mellow lo-fi hip-hop
Tempo: ~78 BPM (slow swing)
Instrumentation: brushed boom-bap drums, dusty upright bass, jazzy Rhodes chords, airy electric-piano lead, faint trumpet stabs, soft vinyl crackle, distant rain ambience
Mood / Tags: cosy • nostalgic • rainy-night • focus • warm analog tape • bedroom-studio
Mix & Texture: slightly muffled highs, gentle side-chain “pump,” light tape hiss, subtle wow-and-flutter; no vocals, no rap—just instrumental
Structure: 4-bar intro → 16-bar loopable groove with occasional dropouts (e.g., muting drums for 2 bars) → soft fade-out; keep melodic elements sparse so it works as background music

Why this works
Tempo & swing (~70–90 BPM with a laid-back groove) evokes the head-nod feel of classic chillhop.

Instrumentation combines jazz-leaning chords with hip-hop rhythm sections—the defining recipe of the genre.

Analog “imperfections” (vinyl crackle, tape flutter, slight high-end roll-off) give the track that warm, bedroom-producer character listeners expect.

Loop-friendly structure keeps distractions low and makes the track blend seamlessly if you put it on repeat.

Try swapping in different ambient layers (fireplace crackle, café chatter), instruments (flute, guitar), or moods (sunny afternoon, winter night) for quick variations while retaining the core lo-fi feel. Enjoy creating!
